## Welcome

to the BackCap-SERVER repository, the **backend** component of the [BackCap](https://github.com/Edems-DEV/BackCap) management system of backups. This project is divided into three parts: web, daemon, and server, which is the focus of this repository. Here you will find the source code for the BackCap backend, which is built using C#. The backend provides REST APIs for fetching data from DB to the frontend and also receives/updates data from deamon. But it is also capable to send reports to users' email at intervals that they set in their profile.
